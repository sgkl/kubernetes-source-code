+ Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.
+ Most Kubernetes resources(e.g. pods, services, replication controllers, and others) are in some namespaces. However namespace resources are not themselves in a namespace. And low-level resources, such as nodes and persistentVolumes, are not in any namespace.
+ To see which Kubernetes resources are and are't in a namespace:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true

kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false
#+END_SRC
