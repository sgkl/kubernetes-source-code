全称Pod Lifecycle Event Generator，

## PodLifecycleEvent

### PodLifeCycleEventType

```go
// PodLifeCycleEventType define the event type of pod life cycle events.
type PodLifeCycleEventType string

const (
	// ContainerStarted - event type when the new state of container is running.
	ContainerStarted PodLifeCycleEventType = "ContainerStarted"
	// ContainerDied - event type when the new state of container is exited.
	ContainerDied PodLifeCycleEventType = "ContainerDied"
	// ContainerRemoved - event type when the old state of container is exited.
	ContainerRemoved PodLifeCycleEventType = "ContainerRemoved"
	// PodSync is used to trigger syncing of a pod when the observed change of
	// the state of the pod cannot be captured by any single event above.
	PodSync PodLifeCycleEventType = "PodSync"
	// ContainerChanged - event type when the new state of container is unknown.
	ContainerChanged PodLifeCycleEventType = "ContainerChanged"
)
```



### PodLifecycleEvent

```go
// PodLifecycleEvent is an event that reflects the change of the pod state.
type PodLifecycleEvent struct {
	// The pod ID.
	ID types.UID
	// The type of the event.
	Type PodLifeCycleEventType
	// The accompanied data which varies based on the event type.
	//   - ContainerStarted/ContainerStopped: the container name (string).
	//   - All other event types: unused.
	Data interface{}
}
```

## PodLifecycleEventGenerator

包括生成pod life cycle events的函数

```go
// PodLifecycleEventGenerator contains functions for generating pod life cycle events.
type PodLifecycleEventGenerator interface {
	Start()
	Watch() chan *PodLifecycleEvent
	Healthy() (bool, error)
}
```

## GenericPLEG

GenericPLEG实现PodLifecycleEventGenerator

```go
type podRecord struct {
	old     *kubecontainer.Pod
	current *kubecontainer.Pod
}

type podRecords map[types.UID]*podRecord
```

方法

```go
func (pr podRecords) getOld(id types.UID) *kubecontainer.Pod

func (pr podRecords) getCurrent(id types.UID) *kubecontainer.Pod

func (pr podRecords) setCurrent(pods []*kubecontainer.Pod)

// 如果id对应的podRecord中current不存在则删除podRecord, 否则将old设置为current,将current设置为空
func (pr PodRecords) update(id types.UID)
```



```go
// GenericPLEG is an extremely simple generic PLEG that relies solely on
// periodic listing to discover container changes. It should be used
// as temporary replacement for container runtimes do not support a proper
// event generator yet.
//
// Note that GenericPLEG assumes that a container would not be created,
// terminated, and garbage collected within one relist period. If such an
// incident happens, GenenricPLEG would miss all events regarding this
// container. In the case of relisting failure, the window may become longer.
// Note that this assumption is not unique -- many kubelet internal components
// rely on terminated containers as tombstones for bookkeeping purposes. The
// garbage collector is implemented to work with such situations. However, to
// guarantee that kubelet can handle missing container events, it is
// recommended to set the relist period short and have an auxiliary, longer
// periodic sync in kubelet as the safety net.
type GenericPLEG struct {
	// The period for relisting.
	relistPeriod time.Duration
	// The container runtime.
	runtime kubecontainer.Runtime
	// The channel from which the subscriber listens events.
	eventChannel chan *PodLifecycleEvent
	// The internal cache for pod/container information.
	podRecords podRecords
	// Time of the last relisting.
	relistTime atomic.Value
	// Cache for storing the runtime states required for syncing pods.
	cache kubecontainer.Cache
	// For testability.
	clock clock.Clock
	// Pods that failed to have their status retrieved during a relist. These pods will be
	// retried during the next relisting.
	podsToReinspect map[types.UID]*kubecontainer.Pod
}
```

### 构造函数

```go
// NewGenericPLEG instantiates a new GenericPLEG object and return it.
func NewGenericPLEG(runtime kubecontainer.Runtime, channelCapacity int,
	relistPeriod time.Duration, cache kubecontainer.Cache, clock clock.Clock) PodLifecycleEventGenerator {
	return &GenericPLEG{
		relistPeriod: relistPeriod,
		runtime:      runtime,
		eventChannel: make(chan *PodLifecycleEvent, channelCapacity),
		podRecords:   make(podRecords),
		cache:        cache,
		clock:        clock,
	}
}
```
